        😆️ Smiling Face With Open Mouth And Closed Eyes
I can't stop laughing! Triggered by incredibly funny or ridiculous situations, the grinning and contorted face emoji 😆 expresses the feeling of being on the verge of a fit of laughter. It is often used to express gleeful or mocking laughter at an event or something that has happened to another person. In text communication, this emoji corresponds to “XD“ and “><“ as text-based emoticons. Within chats, it is used to indicate humorous situations or jokes where laughter becomes uncontrollable. Ultimately, the emoji conveys that you can laugh at the absurdities of life while sharing a common sense of humor with others.
